# Go by drill

This is not just a copy of the [https://gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com/).
I am a newbie in the Go language (I was soon) and in order to become better and faster in it, I study the topics in the [https://gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com/) and try to code similar to it.

And I publish them here so you can quickly clone them and practice.
